1 - new product from zero => new sketch generated
2 - sketched is published => concrete product is generated from sketch with status "published" => original sketh is moved to "published"
3 - new sketch from a product => original product is untouched, a new sketch with status "sketch" is created
4 - sketch from a product is published => current product and originary sketch with "published" status are moved to "history" status,
both new product version and sketch being published are moved to "published" status.
5 - a published version of product is edited => a new sketch from that version is created with the status "sketch" and only the sketch can
be edited from now one until it is being published, when the product can be edited again creating a new sketch.
6 - a sketch is edited => the sketch changes are saved, no product is implied
